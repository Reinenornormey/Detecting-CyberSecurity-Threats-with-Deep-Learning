🔐 Detecting Cybersecurity Threats with Deep Learning
## 📌 Project Overview
Cyber threats are one of the **biggest risks to organizations worldwide**. They come in many forms — malware, phishing, and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks — all capable of stealing sensitive information, halting operations, or causing large-scale disruptions.
Traditional detection methods often fail because they cannot adapt quickly enough to **new and evolving attacks**. This project demonstrates how **deep learning** can be used to enhance threat detection by learning complex patterns from real-world log data.

## 🎯 Objectives
* Build a **deep learning model** that can automatically detect malicious activities.
* Use the **BETH dataset** (preprocessed log data with target labels) to train and evaluate the model.
* Improve **cyber defense strategies** by detecting threats that traditional systems might miss.

## 🧠 Why Deep Learning?
Deep learning models are capable of:
* Analyzing **large-scale log data** efficiently.
* Detecting **subtle patterns and anomalies** that are difficult for human analysts to identify.
* Continuously adapting to **emerging and unknown threats**.
By applying AI to cybersecurity, organizations can **proactively defend** their systems and reduce the damage from cyberattacks.

## 📂 Dataset
* **BETH Dataset** – simulates real-world cybersecurity logs.
* Each entry contains system activity with a target label:
  * `sus_label = 0` → Benign event
  * `sus_label = 1` → Malicious event

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
* **Python 3.10+**
* **PyTorch** – deep learning framework
* **Pandas / NumPy** – data handling
* **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – visualization
* **Scikit-learn** – evaluation metrics

## 🚀 Model Training Workflow
1. **Data Preparation** – load and preprocess the BETH dataset.
2. **Model Architecture** – build a neural network for binary classification.
3. **Training** – optimize using `CrossEntropyLoss` and `SGD` optimizer.
4. **Evaluation** – compute accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. **Testing** – assess generalization on unseen test data.

## 📊 Results
* **Training Accuracy:** ~99.6%
* **Validation Accuracy:** ~99.8%
* **Test Accuracy:** ~94.4%
This shows the model generalizes well but still faces real-world challenges like distribution shifts and adversarial patterns.

## 🔮 Future Improvements
* Experiment with **RNNs or Transformers** for sequential log data.
* Apply **dropout & weight decay** to reduce overfitting.
* Integrate the model into a **real-time intrusion detection system (IDS)**.
* Extend to **multi-class threat classification** (phishing, malware, DoS, etc.).
